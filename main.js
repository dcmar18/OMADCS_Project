    "Status": "Engineering Undeclared",
    "Narrative": "Growing up in the small town of Sedro-Woolley, in Skagit Valley, Lexi established a community at the University of Washington to pursue a degree in Human Centered Design Engineering while following a pre-med pathway. She comes from a Mexican-American household where she is the first in her family to attend college. As a freshman, she was accepted into the College of Engineering as a Freshman Direct student as well as to the Honors Program. Lexi is the oldest of five children and at the beginning of winter quarter her family experienced a hardship when her father had a debilitating stroke. Despite this setback, she was still able to thrive; with the help of her EOP adviser she was successful in acquiring funding to help with the cost of campus parking and gas to see her dad whom she visited often at Harborview hospital.  Lexi also frequently utilizes the Instructional Center which helps with homework and provides both tutors and workshops to help students in all their classes. Her feelings are captured in this quote: “I am very appreciative and grateful for the support of  the OMA&D advising center along with my adviser and the Instructional Center, because without these resources I would not have excelled here at UW.”",

    "Status": "Pre-Major",
    "Narrative": "Anahi is an example of grit and resiliency. She comes from a small rural town called Royal City that’s located in Eastern Washington state. The closest biggest city is Moses Lake (or also Ellensburg). Her family had to move back to Mexico when she was in high school. Anahi stayed back alone to finish and graduate high school and then continued on to UW as a first-gen student. In spite of attending a rural high school, and having no economic or financial support from her family who is far away, she has excelled. She has challenged herself by taking pre-calculus. Anahi’s goal is to help support her family in Mexico but she also wants to make a difference in her community. She hopes to study a major that will allow her to help people from different cultures and economic backgrounds have a better life. I have been impressed by Anahi’s hard work, dedication and commitment to her studies while keeping her kindness, sense of humor and compassion for those around her.",

    "Narrative": "Carla is a courageous, resilient and determined young woman who was violently attacked in Autumn 2019 and kept this trauma to herself, trying her best to move on. Her parents are in Mexico and she lives with her sister. It took a lot for her to break the silence 4-5 months later and share the emotional and physical trauma. We worked closely together to pick up the pieces and connect with key resources to begin the long journey to heal. In addition to this, she worked on paying the outstanding emergency loan in order to register for Spring 2020. Her desire to return to the UW this Spring 2020 is symbolic of her journey to reclaim her life and desire to earn her UW degree. It is for this reason, I like to honor Carla with this recognition for her courage and resilience.",

She is now in the pre nursing major at the UW, and is applying to nursing schools for the upcoming year.

She is a strong advocate for women rights pertaining sexual assault, abuse, rape and mental health awareness for all. Kitnoi is grateful to wake up every morning to continue to work towards her BSN for her family and for the underrepresented Southeast Asian community. Kitnoi is currently working two jobs to be able to support her family, along with being enrolled in classes full time, and being a mentor in “Hey Mentor” (a bridge program for low income/underserved high school students in the area who are interested in going to college).

Her role as an activist in the local Seattle area (co-founder of youth group New Generation, former-member of the NAACP youth-coalition, and others) inspires her to leave a greater mark at the UW. Chardonnay is a part of TRIO, where she has found mentorship in her advisor, IC writing instructor, and various staff of color. Thanks to the UW's center for communication, difference, and equity (CCDE), Chardonnay is currently undergoing research that explores topics of race, identity, and community. Moreover, Chardonnay partnered with the UW Pipeline Project to volunteer at her former elementary school. Her goal: to encourage 4/5 graders to pursue higher education. Chardonnay hopes to create space for students that look like her wherever she goes, similar to those represented in programs like EOP and TRIO. It is imperative that we all do our part to elevate the voice and contribution of Black students at UW, especially the locals. All in all, this award does a great job at promoting the hard-work of OMA&D students!
